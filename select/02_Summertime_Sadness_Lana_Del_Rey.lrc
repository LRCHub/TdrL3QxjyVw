[00:17.40] Kiss me hard before you go
[00:21.52] Summertime sadness
[00:25.88] I just wanted you to know
[00:29.73] That baby, you the best
[00:41.23] 
[00:33.68] I got my red dress on tonight
[00:37.55] Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
[00:41.63] Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
[00:46.07] High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
[01:02.57] 
[00:51.57] Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
[00:55.15] Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
[00:59.66] Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
[01:03.86] Nothin' scares me anymore
[01:06.75] (One, two, three, four)
[01:18.25] 
[01:08.86] Kiss me hard before you go
[01:13.02] Summertime sadness

[01:30.64] Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
[01:34.98] Got that summertime, summertime sadness
[01:39.33] Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[01:47.33] 
[01:42.32] I'm feelin' electric tonight
[01:46.24] Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
[01:50.40] Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
[01:54.48] I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
[02:13.48] 
[02:00.17] Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
[02:03.52] Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
[02:08.03] Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere

[02:55.28] 
[02:51.89] Think I'll miss you forever
[02:55.20] Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
[03:00.33] Later's better than never
[03:03.86] Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (drive), drive
[03:29.36]
